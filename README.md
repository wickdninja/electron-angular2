This is a simple starter for using Angular 2 and Electron to create desktop apps.

### Install

`npm install`

### Build & Run

`npm start`

This will create a build and then start to watch for changes and start the electron app. When you make changes to your scripts it should be picked up, recompiled, and the electron app auto refresh.

### Note

This is work in progress and I will add to it or make changes as I discover new things while developing my app.
